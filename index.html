            <h3>What is Out of Ten made for?</h3>
                <p>
                    Out of Ten is an application that let people vote for other content before they upload it on social media of their choice.
                    You can upload your image and vote for other photo.
                </p>
            <h3>Do I need to use an account?</h3>
            <p>Yes in order to use the application you need to create an account, keep in mind you want to use a real email because you will be asked to verify your email before being able to log in.</p>
            <h3>How do I vote for other people content?</h3>
                <p>
                    It is really easy on the home screen you can see the user's image as well as its name and the current score.
                    If you swipe to the right it means you like its content if you swipe to the left it means you do not like.
                </p>
            <h3>How many photos can I upload at a given time?</h3>
                <p>
                    You can only upload one image at a time, if you already uploaded one it will be replaced by the new one.
                </p>
            <h3>What is the score and how do I interpret it?</h3>
                <p>The score is a way to reprensent what is the opinion of other poeple on your picture. The higher you score is the higher your content is likely to be liked on social media.</p>
                <p>Your photo start with a score of 1'500, if your photo get disliked you will lose some score if it get liked your photo's score will increase.</p>
            <h3>How fast can my score move?</h3>
                <p>It is really hard to answer that, depending on the amout of users using the app your score can be the same for a good period of time but can also move really fast.</p>
                <p>I am working everyday to adjust score so that the score reflects the average score of other photos. In other words it is possible that your score move within a 1h interval because I made some adjustment</p>
            <h3>How can I delete my account?</h3>
            <p>I am sorry to hear that you want to delete your account, just go on your profile page then click on settings and you will see a button to delete your account.</p>
